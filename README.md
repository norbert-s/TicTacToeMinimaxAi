# TicTacToeMinimaxAi

A project implementing the minimax AI algorithm in Java for Tic-Tac-Toe game. 

The Minimax algorithm is a recursive decision-making strategy used in two-player games, where one player aims to maximize their score while the other tries to minimize it.

The game features a simple console layout for displaying the tic tac toe board. 

The computer player uses an advanced version of the minimax algorithm, optimized with alpha-beta pruning, to make optimal moves.

This optimization reduces the search space by avoiding unnecessary exploration of branches, and by that improving the efficiency and depth of the search.

Improvements:

Refactored the code to be more in line with SOLID design principles .
